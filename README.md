# Cypress Angular Schematic

[![npm (scoped)](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@briebug/cypress-schematic.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@briebug/cypress-schematic)

Add [Cypress](https://cypress.io) to an Angular CLI project

This schematic will:

- install Cypress, it's dependencies, and new scripts
- add necessary files for Cypress to work with Angular & Typescript
- prompt for removal of Protractor files and configuration

## Usage üöÄ

Run as one command in an Angular CLI app directory. Note this will add the schematic as a dependency to your project.

```shell
ng add @briebug/cypress-schematic
```

## Thank You üôè

Thanks to Kevin Schuchard for setting up the Schematic Sandbox, and writing the [Jest schematic](https://github.com/briebug/jest-schematic) which inspired this schematic.

> More info on this sandbox approach is detailed in this blog post [kevinschuchard.com/blog/2018-11-20-schematic-sandbox/](https://www.kevinschuchard.com/blog/2018-11-20-schematic-sandbox/)

Also, thank you to Zahid Mahmood for writing [this blog post](https://www.technouz.com/4830/getting-started-with-cypress-to-e2e-test-angular-apps/) detailing setting up cypress in an Angular project.

## Development üõ†

### Getting started

‚öô [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install#mac-stable) is required for the scripts. Make sure it's installed on your machine.

‚¨á **Install** the dependencies for the schematic and the sandbox application

```bash
yarn && cd sandbox && yarn && cd ..
```

üñá **Link** the schematic in the sandbox to run locally

```bash
yarn link:schematic
```

üèÉ **Run** the schematic

```bash
yarn build:clean:launch
```

To execute an example schematic, make sure you've ran the **Install** and **Link** steps above. Then run the following and inspect the changed files.

```bash
git checkout component-license && yarn build:clean:launch
```

## E2E testing

Execute the schematic against the sandbox. Then run linting, unit & e2e tests and a prod build in the sandbox.

```bash
yarn test
```

## Unit Testing

Run the unit tests using Jasmine as a runner and test framework.

```bash
yarn test:unit
```

## Reset the sandbox

Running the schematic locally makes file system changes. The sandbox is version controlled so that viewing a diff of the changes is trivial. After the schematic has run locally, reset the sandbox with the following.

```bash
yarn clean
```

_Note: if you're using the `schematics` CLI mentioned below, you can execute the schematic in a dry run mode._

## Change the Schematic name

1. do a global search and replace for `schematic-starter` and `schematicStarter` with the new name.
2. change the folder name from `./src/schematic-starter/...` to `./src/NEW_NAME/...`
3. run `yarn link:schematic` to set up local package linking for the sandbox

## Optional - Testing with the Schematics CLI

To test locally, install `@angular-devkit/schematics-cli` globally and use the `schematics` command line tool. That tool acts the same as the `generate` command of the Angular CLI but also has a debug mode.

Check the documentation with

```bash
schematics --help
```

## Publishing

To publish, simply do:

```bash
npm run build
npm publish
```
